            <h2>Persona 1:  This guy comes to town and doesn't want to be noticed. He needs a hotel where he can clean his guns and avoid attention. Where better for a sophiticated guy to start than a responsive html chamber of commerce website.</h2>

                Persona 2: The outlaw: This guy comes to town and needs a tub. He's been on the trail for a week and is starting to wreak. He takes his gun with him to the tub in case his enemies find him. He's 35 years old and spends his spare time reading the Wall Street Journal and reading email. Once he finds the gold, that life is over and he's looking to start a saloon of this own - right here in Last Chance. He's the kind of guy that wants repetition in his chamber website.
